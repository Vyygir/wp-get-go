 * This file exists merely due to WordPress' theming method. All assets are
 * compiled with Yarn/Mix, which you can install by navigating to this folder
 * on the command line and running "yarn".
 *
 * If you haven't got Yarn installed, then you'll need to install it from:
 * https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
 *
 * Once Yarn is instaled, navigate to this folder on the command line and run
 * the "yarn" command to install the required dependencies. When the
 * dependencies are installed, then you can run one of the following commands
 * to start compiling assets:
 *
 * 1. "yarn watch": Watch the source files and compile them on save
 * 2. "yarn dev": Compile the source files, once
 * 3. "yarn production": Compile and minify/compress the source files
 *
