/**
 * Theme Name: THEME_NAME
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: THEME_AUTHOR
 *
 * This file exists merely due to WordPress' theming method. All assets are compiled with Gulp,
 * which you can install by navigating to this folder on the command line and running "yarn".
 *
 * If you haven't got Node, Yarn, or Gulp installed then you'll need to install them from the following links:
 *
 * Node: https://nodejs.org/
 * Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
 * Gulp: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
 *
 * Once the above packages are installed and you've verified that they work, then follow the below steps:
 *
 * 1. Open your preferred CLI tool and navigate to this directory
 * 2. Run "yarn"
 * 3. Start the build tools
 *   3.1. To compile everything once, use "gulp compile"
 *   3.2. To watch all assets while you make changes, use "gulp watch"
 *
 * If you don't get any error messages with the above steps, then you'll be able to modify the
 * theme styles correctly and without issue.
